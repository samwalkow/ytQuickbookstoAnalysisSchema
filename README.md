# ytQuickbookstoAnalysisSchema

I'm adding cells with attempts to convert pieces of yt code into the analysis schema. A couple of notes:
- I'm not sure if I'm converting what yt is doing to the analysis schema equivalent. I'm trying to match key words and functionality. Sometimes the best I got was similar functionality, and I'm not sure if this is good enough.
- Often there was a mismatch in input (what the schema wanted) and what yt code produced. So I did a lot of type casting.
- Maybe we should establish a pipeline between objects, operations, and outcome?
